	(64, 'The Truth Regarding Coffee: Is It Healthy or Unhealthy and How Much Should You Drink Daily?', '<p>Coffee is a controversial topic and there is much difference of opinion on whether it is beneficial or harmful to health. Extensive research has been done on coffee consumption and the conclusion is that coffee is actually very beneficial and has a diverse range of health benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Benefits of Drinking Coffee</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Coffee contains many important nutrients such as riboflavin (vitmain B2), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), niacin (vitamin B3), magnesium, manganese and potassium and is one of the biggest sources of antioxidants. It contains more antioxidants than most foods and is a good source of flavonoids, an antioxidant associated with reduced risk of heart disease and cancer. Caffeine itself is an antioxidant that may help to protect against Alzheimer&#39;s and other diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caffeine has been shown to boost your metabolism and increase fat mobilisation and oxidation helping you to lose weight and utilise fat as fuel. It also raises adrenaline levels in the blood which leads to an increase in energy levels, boosting your workouts and improving endurance. Coffee blunts appetite which can help with weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research has shown that coffee improves concentration, memory, mood and overall cognitive function. Caffeine releases a chemical called dopamine which is responsible for controlling motivation and alertness. Coffee also stimulates brain cells to work and communicate faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several studies show that drinking coffee may lower the risk of many diseases, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease, stroke and certain liver diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies indicate that consuming coffee is correlated with longer life expectancy and reduced risk of mortality as well as being associated with a lower risk of developing depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Not All Coffee is Good For You</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As we can see, coffee has many amazing benefits to health. However, just like with many foods these benefits don&rsquo;t mean anything if you are drinking the wrong coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many brands of mass produced and imported coffee contain toxins which are not in the natural coffee bean itself but appear as a result of the way it is grown, processed, stored and distributed. These toxins include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acrylamide &ndash; A natural chemical found in coffee that arises due to roasting at high temperatures</li>\r\n	<li>Ochratoxin A &ndash; A mycotoxin produced by mold found on raw coffee beans as a result of collecting beans from decomposing fruits, leaving them in large piles, bad fermentation processes and storing them in the wrong humidity and temperature conditions</li>\r\n	<li>Pesticides &ndash; More than 90% of coffees worldwide are treated with pesticides and other chemcials including herbicides, fungicides, fertilisers and insectisides which poison the body and cause disease</li>\r\n	<li>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) &ndash; Carcinogenic compounds formed due to high temperature roasting</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Most conventional coffee sold today is deficient in nutrients and made from low quality, non organic coffee beans subject to many defects that occur for a multitude of reasons. These include improper processing practices such as poor roasting, over fermentation and broken or chipped coffee beans, high levels of mold, insect damage, oxidation, improper harvesting, improper moisture content and low standard testing and checking practices. Moreover, if coffee has been sitting for too long it becomes stale and the oils go rancid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to ensure that you are getting the maximum benefit from drinking coffee, only choose coffee that is fresh and grown organically without the use of pesticides and other chemicals. Only purchase from brands that use proper processing, sourcing and production of coffee beans as well as good storage and transportation practices so that the nutritional value is maintained and toxin accumulation and defects minimised.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What About Caffeine?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that the effects of drinking coffee vary from person to person. Common symptoms of consuming too much caffeine include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>anxiety</li>\r\n	<li>restlessness</li>\r\n	<li>irritability</li>\r\n	<li>increased heart rate and blood pressure</li>\r\n	<li>dizziness</li>\r\n	<li>tremors</li>\r\n	<li>digestive issues</li>\r\n	<li>addiction</li>\r\n	<li>trouble sleeping</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you experience any of these symptoms after drinking coffee, then you may be sensitive to caffeine and you may need to either reduce your consumption of coffee or avoid it altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some sources suggest that 3-4 cups of coffee a day are safe for most healthy adults. Some people drink more than that without any experiencing any issues. Some people can drink coffee right before bed and go to sleep. For others, it keeps them awake throughout the night. Everyone has different tolerance levels depending on their genetic makeup as well as how much they are used to drinking so listen to your body and see what is best for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality of the coffee is a big factor as discussed above. Bad coffee is toxic and many people find that these symptoms go away when they switch from mass market, conventional coffee to pure, organic coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For women who are pregnant, it is not recommended to consume coffee or at least reduce your intake as some reports show a link between excessive caffeine consumption to low birth weight and miscarriages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caffeine is also not recommended for people with anxiety or nervous disorders.</p>', '2019-08-18 18:23:07', '2019-08-18 18:28:41', 7, 'coffee_1566152812_jpg', 0, 'truth-regarding-coffee', 11),

This plant produces tiny seeds which are packed with essential fatty acids, protein, fiber and many health-protective antioxidants. In fact, these super-seeds have twice the protein of any other seed or grain, five times the calcium of milk, contain a source of boron which is trace mineral that helps transfer calcium into the bones, and omega 3 and omega 6 which are essential oils, required for proper utilization of vitamins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chia seeds are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Nutritious</strong>. Chia seeds provide a concentrated source of nutrients; they are a good source of B vitamins, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, potassium, boron, and copper. They also provide a source of high quality protein. Chia seeds provide a complete protein source, meaning they contain all the essential amino acids. &nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Easily digestible</strong>. The shells are easily broken down, even when swallowed whole. This is an improvement over flax seed, which have to be ground up to be digested properly. If flax seeds are eaten whole, they will just pass through the body undigested. Also, unlike flax seeds, if chia seeds are ground up they still have a long shelf life due to the presence of natural antioxidants. Flaxseeds, on the other hand must be ground daily to prevent oxidation and loss of nutrients.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>High in dietary fiber</strong>. Chia seeds contain soluble fiber which is easily digestible, it provides a feeling of fullness which aids weight loss, and they bulk up in the intestine, helping to cleanse it out more efficiently.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Mild tasting</strong>. Unlike some seeds, chia seeds are essentially flavorless, so they can be added to any food without changing its flavor.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Rich in omega-3 fatty acids</strong>. These are needed by the body to help emulsify and absorb the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Chia seeds contain the highest content of beneficial alpha-linolenic fatty acid compared to other seeds, including flax seeds.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Water loving</strong>. The seeds can soak up ten times their weight in water. When mixed with water or stomach juices, the seeds form a gel that creates a physical barrier between the carbohydrates and the digestive enzymes that break them down. The carbohydrates thereby are digested and converted into glucose (blood sugar) at a slower, more even rate and also help the body to stay hydrated longer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Regenerating</strong>. After eating, the nutrients present in chia seeds travel to the cells very quickly due to the ease in digestion and assimilation.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Versatile</strong>. The seeds can be added to virtually any food or drink, from water, juices and smoothies, to salads, sauces and bread. The best way to eat the seeds is to take them already hydrated so they will not absorb your own body fluids to hydrate. Try adding a tablespoon of whole or ground seeds to a freshly-made juice or smoothie. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>', '2019-08-19 13:43:40', '2019-08-19 13:43:40', 7, 'chia-seeds_1566222220_jpg', 0, 'chia-seeds', 9),

In reality, the digestion process begins in the mouth. The process of chewing is a important component of the digestive process. The act of chewing breaks down very large amounts of food molecules into smaller particles. This gives the food an increase in surface area, which is an important contributing factor to good digestion. Efficiently chewing your food allows it to be exposed to your saliva for a longer period of time.

	(67, 'End the War on Fat: It Could Be Making Us Sicker', '<h3>End the War on Fat: It Could Be Making Us Sicker</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirty years ago, America declared war against&nbsp;fat. The inaugural edition of Dietary Guidelines for Americans, published in 1980 and subsequently updated every five years, advised people to steer clear of &quot;too much&nbsp;fat,&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat, and&nbsp;cholesterol,&quot; because of purported ties between&nbsp;fat&nbsp;intake and&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease. The message has remained essentially the same ever since, with current guidelines recommending that Americans consume less than 10 percent of their daily&nbsp;calories&nbsp;from&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;continues to devastate the country, and, as you may have noticed, we certainly haven&#39;t gotten any thinner. Ultimately, that&#39;s because&nbsp;fatshould never have been our enemy. The big question is whether the 2010 Dietary Guidelines, due out at the end of the year, will finally announce retreat. Advertisement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation for the &quot;fat is bad&quot; mantra comes from the following logic: Since&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;is known to increase&nbsp;blood&nbsp;levels of &quot;bad&quot; LDL&nbsp;cholesterol, and people with high LDL&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;are more likely to develop&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease,&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;must increase&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;risk. If A equals B and B equals C, then A must equal C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, no. With this extrapolation, scientists and policymakers made a grave miscalculation: They assumed that all LDL&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;is the same and that all of it is bad. A spate of recent research is now overturning this fallacy and raising major questions about the wisdom of avoiding&nbsp;fat, especially considering that the food Americans have been replacing&nbsp;fat&nbsp;with - processed&nbsp;carbohydrates&nbsp;- could be far worse for&nbsp;heart&nbsp;health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, Ronald Krauss, director of atherosclerosis research at the Children&#39;s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, teamed up with researchers in Sweden to tease out some of the more nuanced characteristics of LDL&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;and its role in&nbsp;heart&nbsp;health. The term &quot;LDL cholesterol&quot; refers to the&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;housed in low-density lipoprotein particles, and these particles come in a range of sizes. Krauss and his colleagues analyzed the LDL particles they found in&nbsp;blood&nbsp;samples taken a dozen years earlier from 4,600 Swedish men and women and discovered that concentrations of the small- and medium-sized LDL particles best predicted whether the subjects later developed&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease. Larger LDL particles, they noted in their study, which was published in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology,were essentially neutral with regard to the subjects&#39;&nbsp;heart&nbsp;health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This finding is particularly interesting in light of what Krauss had uncovered years earlier: Men who switch from a low-saturated-fat&nbsp;diet&nbsp;to one high in&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;experience an increase in total&nbsp;blood&nbsp;LDL&nbsp;cholesterol, as expected. But the change is mostly the result of a spike in the&nbsp;concentration&nbsp;of large LDL particles, not small. In other words,&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;consumption typically boosts the number of particles that Krauss has shown to be harmless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blood tests for LDL&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;might not even be a dependable indicator of your risk of&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease. Take, for instance, the infamous Women&#39;s&nbsp;health&nbsp;Initiative hormone trials. Though women on hormone replacement therapy experienced overall drops in LDL&nbsp;cholesterol, they did not suffer fewer&nbsp;heart&nbsp;attacks. The finding initially baffled trial investigators, but further analysis revealed that the women&#39;s LDL particle concentrations had remained exactly the same. Recently, researchers including James Otvos, a biochemist at North Carolina State University, have reported that&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;tests - the kind most doctors administer - accurately predict&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;risk only about 70 percent of the time, because they ignore particle size. (Otvos&#39; company, LipoScience, plans to start selling particle-based&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;tests to doctors&#39; offices later this year.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LDL particles are not the only factor in fat&#39;s exoneration. Large population-based studies are, too. A 2006 study published in the New England Journal of&nbsp;medicine, based on data collected from 82,802 women, found that the subjects who consumed the highest percentage of their daily&nbsp;calories&nbsp;from&nbsp;fat&nbsp;(including saturated fat) did not experience an increased risk of developing&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;later in life. In fact, women who ate the highest amounts of vegetable&nbsp;fat&nbsp;- from foods like&nbsp;olive&nbsp;oil&nbsp;and&nbsp;nuts- had lower risks of&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;than women on low-fat diets. A meta-analysis co-authored by Krauss and published in the March 2010 American Journal of Clinical&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;compared the reported food intakes of nearly 350,000 men and women with their&nbsp;cardiovascular&nbsp;health&nbsp;years later and also found no connection between&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;intake and&nbsp;heart&nbsp;or vascular&nbsp;disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately,&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;- named because it contains no double bonds, so all of its carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen atoms - may be neutral for the&nbsp;heart. Meanwhile, some mono-unsaturated&nbsp;fats&nbsp;(which have one double-bond and are found in many nuts) and some poly-unsaturated&nbsp;fats&nbsp;(which have multiple double bonds and are found in fatty fish) could be good for the&nbsp;heart. For instance, a meta-analysis published in PLoS&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;this month reports that the substitution of&nbsp;polyunsaturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;for&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;can cut&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fat&nbsp;doesn&#39;t adversely affect&nbsp;cardiovascular&nbsp;health, what does? Sorry, Nabisco: We should be giving a closer look to foods with a high&nbsp;glycemic index&nbsp;- a measure that reflects a food&#39;s influence on&nbsp;blood&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;levels, based on how quickly it is digested and absorbed. Typically, that means&nbsp;carbohydrates&nbsp;like cereal,&nbsp;bread, chips, and cookies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2000 study in the American Journal of Clinical&nbsp;nutrition, Harvard researchers compared the food intakes of 75,521 women with their&nbsp;health&nbsp;over the course of a decade and found that the quintile of women who ate food with the highest glycemic load - a measure that incorporates portion size - had twice the risk of developing&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;than the quintile who ate food with the lowest glycemic load. A 2008 meta-analysis of 37 studies reported a significant association between intake of high&nbsp;glycemic index&nbsp;foods and increased risk of&nbsp;type 2&nbsp;diabetes,&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease, gallbladder&nbsp;disease, and&nbsp;Breast&nbsp;cancer. Some studies suggest, however, that the bad effects of high-G.I. foods can be tempered by pairing them with low-G.I. foods. For instance, a piece of white&nbsp;bread&nbsp;smeared with peanut&nbsp;butter&nbsp;may be healthier than a piece of white&nbsp;bread&nbsp;alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The link between&nbsp;carbohydrates&nbsp;and&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;is also supported by LDL particle data. In a 2008 study published in&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;Research, researchers reported that subjects who followed high-fat, low-carb diets for eight weeks experienced a 46 percent drop in&nbsp;blood&nbsp;concentrations of small LDL particles, while those who followed a high-carb, low-fat&nbsp;diet&nbsp;experienced a 36 percent spike in them. What&#39;s more, processed&nbsp;carbohydrates&nbsp;lower &quot;good&quot; HDL&nbsp;cholesterol, whereas&nbsp;saturated&nbsp;fatincreases it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as different&nbsp;fats&nbsp;affect the&nbsp;body&nbsp;in dissimilar ways, it seems that sugars are not all created equal. Though&nbsp;fructose&nbsp;actually has a lower&nbsp;glycemic index, it may be a bit less healthy than&nbsp;glucose, a&nbsp;sugar&nbsp;with the same chemical formula but a different structure. (Sucrose, or table&nbsp;sugar, is 50 percent&nbsp;glucose&nbsp;and 50 percent fructose; high-fructose&nbsp;corn&nbsp;syrup is typically 55 percent&nbsp;fructose&nbsp;and 45 percent&nbsp;glucose.) Research published by Peter Havel, a professor of&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;at the University of California-Davis, suggests that compared with&nbsp;glucose,&nbsp;fructose&nbsp;incites less of an insulin response, which ultimately results in lower circulating levels of the appetite-suppressing hormone leptin and higher levels of the appetite-boosting hormone ghrelin - so&nbsp;fructose&nbsp;may make you hungrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could also put you at greater risk of&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;and&nbsp;diabetes. When&nbsp;overweight&nbsp;people supplemented their diets with drinks sweetened either with&nbsp;fructose&nbsp;or with&nbsp;glucose&nbsp;for 10 weeks,&nbsp;fructose&nbsp;drinkers ended up with higher concentrations of small LDL particles in their&nbsp;blood&nbsp;after they ate. They also experienced, on average, a 20 percent drop in insulin sensitivity - low insulin sensitivity is a risk factor for&nbsp;type 2&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;- over the course of the experiment compared with the&nbsp;glucose&nbsp;drinkers. (Havel believes that the&nbsp;glycemic index&nbsp;is ultimately flawed and that a &quot;fructose index&quot; might be a better&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;metric.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, it seems that processed&nbsp;carbohydrates&nbsp;are America&#39;s most deserving nutritional enemy. And our misguided war against&nbsp;fat&nbsp;has just made us more addicted to them, because when people cut out&nbsp;fat, they typically turn to &quot;diet&quot; foods high in carbs - SnackWells, Baked Lays, even low-fat Jif, which contains the same number of&nbsp;calories&nbsp;as the regular version, with less peanut&nbsp;butter&nbsp;and more &quot;corn syrup solids.&quot; That&#39;s not to say that all carbs are bad;&nbsp;fiber&nbsp;is a&nbsp;carbohydrate, and an important one. And there is still a lot left to be desired about certain&nbsp;fats. Trans&nbsp;fats&nbsp;really are bad for you, and foods very high in&nbsp;omega-6&nbsp;polyunsaturated&nbsp;fats&nbsp;- such as&nbsp;corn&nbsp;oil&nbsp;and&nbsp;margarine&nbsp;- are not particularly healthy, either. But overall, Americans could stand to start replacing carbs with&nbsp;fat. More bacon, fewer Bacos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will this new research on&nbsp;fat&nbsp;and carbs will be reflected in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines? According to Meir Stampfer, a Harvard professor of&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;and epidemiology who worked on the 2000 guidelines, scientists on this year&#39;s committee know perfectly well what the evidence says. But few researchers want to shake the status quo or risk confusing the public. Robert Post, deputy director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Center for nutrition&nbsp;Policy and Promotion, admits that when it comes to nutritional recommendations, &quot;simple messages, few messages, targeted messages, are very important.&quot; Ultimately, then, policymakers have to choose between keeping the message consistent and actually getting it right.</p>', '2019-08-19 13:48:13', '2019-08-19 13:48:13', 7, 'fish_1566222493_jpg', 0, 'war-on-fat', 11),

Here are some factors which have been found to help improve intellect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exercise</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists are continuing to find new evidence which points to a link between physical&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;and&nbsp;mental&nbsp;health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Cambridge University study suggested that jogging just a couple of times a week stimulates the&nbsp;brain. After a few days of&nbsp;running, hundreds of thousands of new&nbsp;brain&nbsp;cells were shown to have grown in a region that is linked to the formation and recollection of memories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An improved ability to recall memories without confusing them has a direct impact on other crucial cognitive tasks, and could lead to potential new ways of slowing down the deterioration of mental ability in old age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other findings, scientists have also found that vigorous&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;helps release a&nbsp;protein&nbsp;called&nbsp;&#39;noggin&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;protein&nbsp;acts as with another&nbsp;protein,&nbsp;bone morphogenetic protein, and stimulates the division of&nbsp;brain&nbsp;stem cells, keeping the&nbsp;brain&nbsp;nimble and active as we get older. Research suggests that amplified production of noggin could therefore prevent the on-set of age-related&nbsp;brain&nbsp;diseases such as&nbsp;Alzheimer&#39;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Mid-Day Nap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists have long suspected that&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;has a significant impact on the brain&#39;s capacity for&nbsp;memory, but recent research has found that sleeping for an hour in the afternoon boosts&nbsp;brain&nbsp;power and dramatically increases its ability to learn new facts and tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a nap after lunch acts as a regenerative aid, allowing the&nbsp;brain&nbsp;to &#39;file&#39; away memories so that new information may be more easily retained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers discovered that those who stay awake all day are less likely to be able to learn new tasks as the day goes on, leading the experts to suggest that napping in the long-term may be conducive to warding off age-related degenerative mental diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Magnesium and Vitamin B-Rich Foods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating foods rich in&nbsp;magnesium&nbsp;such as&nbsp;spinach&nbsp;and&nbsp;broccoli, as well as high doses of B-vitamins are associated with boosting&nbsp;memory&nbsp;and&nbsp;brain&nbsp;power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research published in the journal&nbsp;Neuron, found that an increase of&nbsp;magnesium&nbsp;in the&nbsp;brain&nbsp;could help learning in both the young and old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other research found that high doses of B&nbsp;vitamins&nbsp;halved the rate of&nbsp;brain&nbsp;shrinkage in older people experiencing signs of&nbsp;memory&nbsp;decline. Certain B&nbsp;vitamins, including&nbsp;folic&nbsp;acid,&nbsp;vitamin B6&nbsp;and B12 - were also found to control levels of a substance known as homocysteine in the&nbsp;blood. High levels of homocysteine are associated with faster&nbsp;brain&nbsp;shrinkage and&nbsp;Alzheimer&#39;s&nbsp;disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food sources of B&nbsp;vitamins&nbsp;include&nbsp;meat,&nbsp;fish,&nbsp;eggs,&nbsp;asparagus,&nbsp;lentils, most&nbsp;beans, and leafy green&nbsp;vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sun Exposure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists have found that increased exposure to the&nbsp;sun&nbsp;is linked to boosting your intellect and preventing&nbsp;dementia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A larger intake in&nbsp;vitamin D, which can also be found in oily&nbsp;fish, was linked to a greater ability to keep the&nbsp;brain&nbsp;active and in top condition as we age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another study published in the&nbsp;Journal of Neurology&nbsp;found that an association between increased&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;and faster information processing was particularly significant in men over the age of 60 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mowing the Lawn</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers have discovered that a chemical released by lawn mowing not only relieves&nbsp;stress&nbsp;and makes people happier, but could also prevent mental decline in old age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian scientists claimed that the aroma of freshly cut grass works directly on the&nbsp;brain, particularly targeting areas associated with emotion and&nbsp;memory. These are known as the&nbsp;amygdalaand the&nbsp;hippocampus&nbsp;and are the two areas that are responsible for the flight or fight response and the endocrine system, which controls the releasing of&nbsp;stress&nbsp;hormones&nbsp;like corticosteroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chronic&nbsp;stress&nbsp;has been shown to damage the hippocampus (an area of the&nbsp;brain&nbsp;that helps regulate emotion and memory), by reducing the number of connections between communicating cells, leading to&nbsp;memory&nbsp;loss, sometimes irreversible.</p>', '2019-08-19 13:50:29', '2019-08-19 13:50:29', 7, 'brain_1566222629_jpg', 0, 'ways-boost-brainpower', 18),
	(69, 'Keep Fit, Strong and Supple For a Healthier Body and Mind', '<p>It is a well-proven fact that exercise is good for both your body and mind. Numerous studies over the years have shown that exercise is effective in preventing all kinds of diseases from heart disease to diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis. Simply by increasing your level of physical activity to about 15 minutes of jogging, cycling or swimming, or 30 minutes of walking a day - is associated with cutting your risk of premature death by about 20 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nA misconception about exercise is that you have to put in a lot of effort to get any noticeable benefit. However, simple activities such as walking have equally as good effects as vigorous exercise. Recent studies have found that in patients with type-2 diabetes, walking daily improved their blood fat levels, which reduces the risk of heart disease.&nbsp;Other research found that more than 10,000 cases of breast and bowel cancer could be prevented each year by increasing physical activity such as going for brisk walks or performing vigorous household chores.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exercise for Better mental health</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a huge body of evidence showing that exercise is vital for a healthy state of mind. For example, a study involving 10,000 participants found that those engaged in regular physical activity had much lower levels of anxiety, stress or depression. There was also a direct association between the amount of time spent in from of the TV or computer and poor mental health.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exercise literally prevents the physical deterioration of the brain. Our brains become less dense and lose volume as we age, and with that comes mental decline. Researchers used MRI scans to examine the brains of 55 elderly people. Those who exercised more and were more physically fit had the densest brains.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exercise for weight Control</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main benefits of exercise is that it increases your metabolic rate which means that you will use up more calories. Muscle cells use up more calories than fat cells, which helps with weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exercise for Stronger bones</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Exercise is great for the bones and joints. Stressing the bones with weight-bearing exercise, such as walking or weight-lifting, tells the bones to &#39;toughen up&#39;. Clinical trials have shown that exercise is needed in addition to a good diet for bone health. Even gentle exercise has been found to prevent loss of bone mineral density, and the younger you are when you start exercising, the more positively it affects bone density and strength in later life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exercise to Increase lifespan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to research, regular exercise keeps signs of aging away and can prolong lifespan. However, the exercise must continue late into life and be sustained enough to raise the heart rate. It is thought that keeping the body fit helps fight the signs of aging by naturally stimulating the release of human growth hormone (HGH), which is key for strength, health, and longevity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you reach your 30s, you enter a phase called somatopause, in which HGH levels start decreasing dramatically. This is partly what drives the aging process. If you lead a sedentary lifestyle and don&#39;t exercise, your HGH levels will drop even further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given all these health benefits, who wouldn&#39;t want to exercise? Even 15 minutes a day can make a big difference to how you feel. Exercise immediately gives you more energy and mental clarity, making you more efficient and effective throughout the day. It is one of the key ways to optimize your overall health, from losing weight and gaining muscle, to improving your posture and physique, to living a longer healthier life, inshaa&#39;Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Which Exercises Are Best</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The main categories of exercise are aerobic, resistance training and &#39;core&#39; exercises, which stretch and tone the muscles. For peak fitness, a combination of all of these should be incorporated into your exercise regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good forms of aerobic exercise are cycling, walking and jogging, which are beneficial for cardiovascular health. These should be combined with stretching and toning exercises, and strength training, which help to develop muscle strength and mass, and keep the body supple. Swimming is an excellent all-round exercise, and workouts like yoga and Pilates help to strengthen and tone &#39;core&#39; muscles like the back, and maintain suppleness.</p>', '2019-08-19 13:53:43', '2019-08-19 13:53:43', 9, 'man-running-on-hill_1566222823_jpg', 0, 'keep-fit-healthier-body-and-mind', 12),

Although&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;deficiency has been linked with a growing list of illnesses, including&nbsp;cancer,&nbsp;heart&nbsp;disease&nbsp;and autoimmune diseases, until now scientists have not been able to show how it could trigger so many different disorders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research has now found that&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;protects the body against a range of serious illnesses by binding to the DNA of the body&#39;s cells and directly controlling the genes implicated in diseases such as&nbsp;multiple sclerosis,&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;and&nbsp;cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the first time that scientists have found direct evidence to suggest that this amazing substance, which is made by the&nbsp;skin&nbsp;in the presence of&nbsp;sunlight, directly controls a network of genes linked with a wide variety of serious disorders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest study suggests a possible mechanism by showing that&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;binds directly to parts of the human genome that house the genes known to be linked with these serious autoimmune disorders, which result from a person&#39;s&nbsp;immune system&nbsp;attacking the body&#39;s own tissues. One of the researchers said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A surprisingly large number of genes that have been highlighted by gene-associated studies in autoimmunity and&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;seem to be regulated by&nbsp;vitamin D,&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is indirect, but intriguing evidence that&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;will prove to be a major player in the key gene-environment interactions that expose us to diseases.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Study Details</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers analyzed human cells that had been stimulated by the active form of&nbsp;vitamin D. They found that the&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;receptor&nbsp;protein&nbsp;bonded to a total of 2,776 sites along the DNA of the genome. They also found that the vitamin had a significant effect on altering the activity of 229 genes located near to these sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We screened the whole genome and found all the sites where&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;binds. The evidence is now quite solid that not only is there binding but we&#39;ve been able to show that it actually affects the functioning of the gene. It&#39;s not just sticking to that region, it&#39;s actually altering gene expression,&quot;&nbsp;the study author said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We show there&#39;s an excess of genes that are associated with a bunch of autoimmune conditions that seem to have the&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;regulation feature. I don&#39;t think we can say [this is] cause and effect, but it&#39;s not a coincidence. It is clearly not there by chance. There&#39;s a very substantial bias among these genes that have been highlighted as playing a role in these autoimmune conditions, and that have turned out to be regulated by&nbsp;vitamin D,&quot;&nbsp;he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another of the authors said the findings suggest&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;supplements may be important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is now evidence supporting a role for&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;in susceptibility to a host of diseases.&nbsp;Vitamin D&nbsp;supplements during&nbsp;pregnancy&nbsp;and the early years could have a beneficial effect on a child&#39;s&nbsp;healthin later life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamin D is created in the body from&nbsp;cholesterol. It influences the entire body - receptors that respond to this vitamin have been found in almost every type of human cell, from the&nbsp;brain&nbsp;to&nbsp;bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new research provides evidence that&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;does more than just aid in the absorption of&nbsp;calcium&nbsp;and bone formation - it is also involved in multiple repair and maintenance functions, affects thousands of different genes, regulates the&nbsp;immune system, and much, much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These ground-breaking findings highlight the importance of having adequate levels of&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;in the body, but many people, unless they have taken specific measures to address it, are likely to be deficient in this important nutrient.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ways to Get Vitamin D</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamin D is produced naturally by the&nbsp;skin&nbsp;but only in the presence of&nbsp;sunlight. Sunshine contains ultraviolet light B (UVB) which converts a substance in the&nbsp;skin, called&nbsp;7-dehydrocholesterol, into vitamin D3. This can then be converted by the liver and kidneys into the biologically active form of&nbsp;vitamin D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vitamin is also present in relatively high amounts in&nbsp;fish&nbsp;and&nbsp;shellfish, and in lower amounts in&nbsp;eggs&nbsp;and dairy produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By far the easiest and best way of delivering enough&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;to the body is to expose&nbsp;skin&nbsp;to direct&nbsp;sunlight&nbsp;for a few minutes each day.</p>', '2019-08-19 13:55:36', '2019-08-19 13:55:36', 9, 'leaves_1566222936_jpg', 0, 'vitamin-d-diseases', 17),

For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fish is an excellent source of&nbsp;protein, however, most&nbsp;fish&nbsp;is loaded with harmful contaminants like&nbsp;mercury, so should be eaten in moderation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMeat is one of the main sources of&nbsp;protein&nbsp;in many peoples&#39; diets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nEggs are also abundant in&nbsp;protein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPlants such as&nbsp;beans&nbsp;and&nbsp;nuts&nbsp;provide a good source of both&nbsp;protein&nbsp;and&nbsp;fiber.<br />\r\nSome foods contain all of the essential&nbsp;amino acids&nbsp;that the body needs; these are called&nbsp;complete proteins. There are other foods, however that provide some or none of the essential&nbsp;amino acids, and are referred to as&nbsp;incomplete proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eggs, dairy foods,&nbsp;meat,&nbsp;fish&nbsp;and poultry are typically considered to be complete proteins. Vegetarians or vegans often do not have a source of complete&nbsp;protein&nbsp;in their diets, but can easily obtain all of the essential&nbsp;amino acids&nbsp;by eating a variety of&nbsp;beans,&nbsp;grains,&nbsp;nuts,&nbsp;seeds, and&nbsp;vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[1] Weigle et al&nbsp;A high-protein&nbsp;diet&nbsp;induces sustained reductions in appetite, ad libitum caloric intake, and body&nbsp;weight&nbsp;despite compensatory changes in diurnal plasma leptin and ghrelin concentrations.Am J Clin Nutr 2005, pages 41-8.</p>', '2019-08-19 14:07:45', '2019-08-19 14:07:45', 8, 'fish_1566223665_jpg', 0, 'why-we-need-protein', 11),
	(75, 'Five Foods That Aid Weight Loss', '<p>The best way to lose weight and keep the weight off is to change the way you eat on a daily basis, by choosing a variety of healthy foods and eating in moderation. This will ensure an adequate supply of antioxidants vital for boosting immunity and protecting the body against disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some foods that studies support as being effective fat-burners, thus potentially aiding weight loss when eaten as part of a balanced, healthy diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grapefruit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Naringenin</em>, a flavonoid in grapefruit, balances out blood sugar levels and helps to prevent metabolic syndrome, a pre-diabetic condition associated with weight gain. Scientists at the&nbsp;<em>University of Western Ontario</em>&nbsp;found it worked by programming the liver to burn up excess fat, rather than store it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When patients drank grapefruit juice before each meal, they lost between nearly 4-10lb in weight over three months, according to a study at the&nbsp;<em>University of California</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Capsaicin</em>, the heat-producing molecule that gives chili peppers their kick, is thermogenic, meaning it speeds up metabolism and heat production. Research has found that cells can burn up to 25 per cent more calories after a person has eaten chili. Trials at&nbsp;<em>Maastricht University</em>&nbsp;found that chili peppers also reduce appetite by suppressing hunger and prolonging the feeling of fullness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Green tea</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Green tea speeds up the rate your body burns cellular energy by up to 40 per cent, according to research reported in the&nbsp;<em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plant also increases the rate of fat burning. Researchers have found this effect is caused by the combination of caffeine and flavonoids found in the tea, whether it is drunk hot or cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cinnamon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A study published in the&nbsp;<em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>&nbsp;found that when volunteers were given rice pudding with three grams of cinnamon, they produced less insulin after the meal. Insulin is the hormone that turns excess sugar into fat, so this means less weight gain. Furthermore, cinnamon may slow down emptying of the stomach, meaning it can make you feel fuller for longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coconut oil</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coconut fat has found to have fewer calories per gram than other fats, producing only 6.8 calories per gram rather than 9 calories like most fats. Unlike many others, calories in coconut oil act more like carbohydrates, being burned by the liver for immediate energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>, the body digests coconut oil more easily than the fats in butter or spreads, rapidly converting it into a source of energy.</p>', '2019-08-19 16:05:57', '2019-08-19 16:06:36', 8, 'good-diet_1566230757_jpg', 0, 'five-foods-weight-loss', 15),
	(76, 'Make Simple Changes to Reduce Inflammation', '<p>Inflammation refers to the immune response triggered within the body in response to a variety of conditions. Factors that determine the levels of inflammatory processes in the body can include nutrition, lifestyle, fitness, stress and presence of harmful substances in the body such as toxins, harmful bacteria, viruses, etc.<br />\r\nThis is known as systematic inflammation and it is now being understood that the degree of inflammatory response in the body underlies the development of disease conditions including cancer, diabetes, heart disease and many other health conditions. In fact, in the case of heart disease, cholesterol is now quietly being discounted as the prime suspect, whilst more and more focus is being placed on inflammation and oxidation (due to free-radicals).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your body can unnecessarily trigger and maintain inflammatory responses when they are not really needed - and this occurs as a result of the factors mentioned previously, diet and lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ways to decrease systematic inflammation include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Increasing exercise and physical activity</li>\r\n	<li>Consuming a healthy, wholesome, nutrient-rich diet, free of refined and processed foods</li>\r\n	<li>Minimizing stress</li>\r\n	<li>Maintaining a healthy weight</li>\r\n	<li>exercise</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of people have sedentary jobs, or spend a large portion of their time being inactive. Incorporating a form of daily exercise to decrease systemic inflammation can be as simple as taking a walk, gardening, or doing housework.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>diet</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Diet is just as important, if not more, as exercise, when trying to decrease inflammation. Many diets are pro-inflammatory, with sugar, refined flour, and trans fats making up a large percentage of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To reduce inflammation, reduce your consumption of these processed foods. Grains have also been found to contain several potentially problematic substances, such as gluten, lectin, and phytates, and they promote an inflammatory acidic pH, and disrupt proper blood sugar regulation. Therefore, some nutritionists believe that consumption of grains should be minimized to reduce inflammation (see references).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increase your consumption of fresh foods, including</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Raw or lightly cooked fruit and vegetables</li>\r\n	<li>Seeds, nuts, sprouts</li>\r\n	<li>Herbs, spices and sea salt to flavor food</li>\r\n	<li>Extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil and butter (not margarine)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to exercise and diet, supplements can help to reduce inflammation. But remember that nutritional supplements are supposed to be taken in addition to a healthy diet.

Body weight, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum ketones were unchanged; insulin and nonesterified fatty acids were decreased. We now present data on other hormones and metabolites considered to be affected by dietary macronutrient changes. The test diet resulted in an elevated fasting plasma total insulin-like growth factor 1, but not growth hormone. Urinary aldosterone was unchanged; free cortisol was increased, although not statistically. Urinary pH and calcium were unchanged. blood pressure, creatinine clearance, serum vitamin B12, folate, homocysteine, thyroid hormones, and uric acid were unchanged. Serum creatinine was modestly increased. Plasma &plusmn;-amino nitrogen and urea nitrogen were increased. Urea production rate was increased such that a new steady state was present. The calculated urea production rate accounted for 87% of protein ingested on the control diet, but only 67% on the test diet, suggesting net nitrogen retention on the latter. The lack of negative effects, improved glucose control, and a positive nitrogen balance suggest beneficial effects for subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus at risk for loss of lean body mass.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAnd another:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric C Westman, William S Yancy Jr., John C Mavropoulos, Megan Marquart, and Jennifer R McDuffie.

Nutrition &amp; metabolism 2008, 5:36 (19 December 2008).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the abstract:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Objective</strong><br />\r\nDietary carbohydrate is the major determinant of postprandial glucose levels, and several clinical studies have shown that low-carbohydrate diets improve glycemic control. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a diet lower in carbohydrate would lead to greater improvement in glycemic control over a 24-week period in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Research design and methods: Eighty-four community volunteers with obesity and type 2 diabetes were randomized to either a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (&lt;20 g of carbohydrate daily; LCKD) or a low-glycemic, reduced-calorie diet (500 kcal/day deficit from weight maintenance diet; LGID). Both groups received group meetings, nutritional supplementation, and an exercise recommendation. The main outcome was glycemic control, measured by hemoglobin A1c.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Results</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forty-nine (58.3%) participants completed the study. Both interventions led to improvements in hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and weight loss. The LCKD group had greater improvements in hemoglobin A1c (-1.5% vs. -0.5%, p=0.03), body weight (-11.1 kg vs. -6.9 kg, p=0.008), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (+5.6 mg/dL vs. 0 mg/dL, p&lt;0.001) compared to the LGID group. diabetes medications were reduced or eliminated in 95.2% of LCKD vs. 62% of LGID participants (p&lt;0.01).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dietary modification led to improvements in glycemic control and medication reduction/elimination in motivated volunteers with type 2 diabetes. The diet lower in carbohydrate led to greater improvements in glycemic control, and more frequent medication reduction/elimination than the low glycemic index diet. Lifestyle modification using low carbohydrate interventions is effective for improving and reversing type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>They also state in their 30 page paper, in the discussion:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In this study, both a low glycemic index, reduced-calorie diet and a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet led to improvement in glycemic control, diabetic medication elimination/reduction, and weight loss in adherent overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes over a 24-week period. The diet containing fewer carbohydrates, the LCKD, was most effective for improving glycemic control. In patients taking insulin, the effects were often quite powerful. For example, participants taking from 40 to 90 units of insulin before the study were able to eliminate their insulin use, while also improving glycemic control. Because this effect occurs immediately upon implementing the dietary changes, individuals with type 2 diabetes who are unable to adjust their own medication or self-monitor their blood glucose should not make these dietary changes unless under close medical supervision.<br />\r\nThe underlying principle of carbohydrate-restriction and the historic precedents of using the low-carbohydrate diet for type 2 diabetes suggest that the low-carbohydrate approach may be one of the most effective dietary treatments for diabetes.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAnd in the conclusion:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In summary, lifestyle modification using two diets that reduce carbohydrate intake led to improvement in glycemic control, diabetic medication elimination/reduction, and weight loss in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes over a 24-week period in the outpatient setting. The diet containing fewer carbohydrates, the lowcarbohydrate, ketogenic diet, was more effective for improving glycemic control than the low glycemic diet. Lifestyle modification using low-carbohydrate diet interventions are effective for improving obesity and type 2 diabetes, and may play an important role in reversing the current epidemic of &#39;diabesity.&#39;<br />\r\nSome other quotes from the authors of the study in reporting coverage:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients who followed the no-glycemic diet experienced more frequent reductions, and in some cases elimination, of their need for medication to control type 2 diabetes, according to lead author Eric Westman, MD, director of Duke&#39;s Lifestyle medicine Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;Low glycemic diets are good, but our work shows a no-glycemic diet is even better at improving blood sugar control,&quot; he says. &quot;We found you can get a three-fold improvement in type 2 diabetes as evidenced by a standard test of the amount of sugar in the blood. That&#39;s an important distinction because as a physician who is faced with the choice of drugs or diet, I want a strong diet that&#39;s shown to improve type 2 diabetes and minimize medication use.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>And also:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s simple,&quot; says Westman. &quot;If you cut out the carbohydrates, your blood sugar goes down, and you lose weight which lowers your blood sugar even further. It&#39;s a one-two punch.&quot;<br />\r\nThe diet is not easy for everybody. &quot;This is a therapeutic diet for people who are sick,&quot; says Westman. &quot;These lifestyle approaches all have an intensive behavioral component. In our program, people come in every two weeks to get reinforcements and reminders. We&#39;ve treated hundreds of patients this way now at Duke and what we see clinically and in our research shows that it works.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>', '2019-08-19 16:11:42', '2019-08-19 16:11:42', 9, 'mediterranean-food_1566231102_jpg', 0, 'low-carb-diets', 17),
	(78, 'Boost Your Immune System For The Winter', '<p>The&nbsp;cold&nbsp;days of the&nbsp;winter&nbsp;months in particular, see a rise in respiratory tracts&nbsp;infections&nbsp;such as&nbsp;colds&nbsp;and&nbsp;flu. So as&nbsp;winter&nbsp;approaches, it&#39;s worth taking steps to boost your immunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are fit and your&nbsp;immune system&nbsp;is healthy, your&nbsp;body&nbsp;can often fight off&nbsp;infections&nbsp;that cause upper respiratory&nbsp;infections&nbsp;without developing sniffles, coughs, sneezes or sore throats. It is usually when the&nbsp;body&nbsp;is lacking in nutrients, stressed or feeling tired and run down, that symptoms tend to strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An Immune-Boosting&nbsp;diet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to boosting the&nbsp;immune system,&nbsp;dietshould always come first. Even a minor lack of some nutrients can lower your immunity and lead to increased risk of&nbsp;disease. For example,&nbsp;viral&nbsp;infectionsare more likely in those lacking&nbsp;selenium&nbsp;or&nbsp;Vitamin C, both of which help to suppress the activation of viral genes. The&nbsp;cold sore&nbsp;virus (Herpes simplex) and recurrent&nbsp;candida&nbsp;(thrush) are also more common when&nbsp;iron&nbsp;levels are depleted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To boost immunity, maximize your intake of fruits and&nbsp;vegetables. Try to eat as many as possible raw or lightly steamed to preserve their nutrient content. But&nbsp;winter&nbsp;warmers such as soups and stews are also great for boosting immunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>essential&nbsp;fatty acids&nbsp;are also important for immune function. They regulate the way immune cells react to chemical signals, known as &#39;cytokines&#39; and shield immune cells against damaging by-products of your&nbsp;metabolism, such as&nbsp;free radicals. So aim to increase your intake of oily&nbsp;fish, or take&nbsp;fish&nbsp;oil&nbsp;supplements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>probiotics&nbsp;are another beneficial food to include in the&nbsp;diet. Most of or immune defences are found in the wall of the small&nbsp;intestines. Beneficial lactic acid-producing&nbsp;bacteria&nbsp;stimulate immunity here, by secreting natural&nbsp;antibiotics&nbsp;and stimulating the production of&nbsp;interferon, a natural anti-viral agent which helps protect against&nbsp;viral&nbsp;infections. Eat more cultured dairy products like&nbsp;yoghurt&nbsp;and fermented foods like&nbsp;sauerkraut&nbsp;to increase your levels of&nbsp;probiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stress</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the&nbsp;body&nbsp;is stressed and run down, it is twice as likely to develop symptoms when exposed to a&nbsp;common&nbsp;cold&nbsp;virus. This is thought to be a result of high levels of&nbsp;stress&nbsp;hormones&nbsp;and depleted adrenal glands that interfere with immune function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;has been proven to boost immunity. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it is probably linked with burning off the effects of&nbsp;stress, so the&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;should therefore be non-competitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A study from 2010 found that people who exercised for at least five days a week and felt physically fit and active, cut their chances of having a&nbsp;cold&nbsp;by almost half. Taking regular&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;also cut the severity of symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One theory is that&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;improves the circulation of immune cells in the&nbsp;blood. The role of these cells is to neutralize pathogens, or disease-causing organisms throughout the&nbsp;body. The better these cells circulate, the more efficient the&nbsp;immune system&nbsp;is at locating and defending against viruses and diseases trying to attack the&nbsp;body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>sleep</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep is an essential way of relaxation, regeneration and rejuvenation in which the&nbsp;body&nbsp;secretes substances involved in&nbsp;healing&nbsp;and fighting off&nbsp;disease. It is believed that during&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;the whole&nbsp;bodyis restored. During deep&nbsp;sleep, the&nbsp;body&nbsp;enters its most intense period of growth, building new proteins and repairing or replacing cells. So getting an adequate amount of good quality&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;is essential for a strong&nbsp;immune system.</p>', '2019-08-19 16:13:30', '2019-08-19 16:13:30', 9, 'fresh-water_1566231210_jpg', 0, 'boost-immune-system-winter', 10),
	(79, 'Research: Trans-Fats Increase Risk of Depression, While Olive Oil Helps Avoid Risk', '<p>A new study has demonstrated that the ingestion of trans-fats increases the risk of suffering depression, and that olive oil, on the other hand, protects against this mental illness.<br />\r\nTrans fats are found naturally occurring in very small amounts in meat and dairy products, but the bulk of trans fats in the modern diet are found in many baked goods, snacks and other packaged and processed foods. They are synthetically produced by the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils, by processing vegetable oils to increase their shelf-life. Unlike other fats, trans fats have no nutritional value to the human body, but have come to be widely used in restaurants and packaged foods, because they hold flavor longer and have a greater shelf life than non-hydrogenated oils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study Details</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists studied 12,059 volunteers over the course of six years; the volunteers had their diet, lifestyle and ailments analyzed at the beginning of the project, over its course and at the end of the project. In this way the researchers confirmed that despite the fact that at the beginning of the study none of the volunteers suffered from depression, at the end of the study 657 new cases had been detected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all these cases, the participants with an elevated consumption of trans-fats &quot;presented up to a 48% increase in the risk of depression when they were compared to participants who did not consume these fats,&quot; one author of the article said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the study demonstrated a dose-response relationship, &quot;whereby the more trans-fats were consumed, the greater the harmful effect they produced in the volunteers,&quot; the expert stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the team also analyzed the influence of polyunsaturated fats (abundant in fish and vegetable oils) and of olive oil (a type of monounsaturated fat) on the occurrence of depression. &quot;In fact, we discovered that this type of healthier fats, together with olive oil, are associated with a lower risk of suffering depression,&quot; emphasized the researcher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the research was performed on a population with a low average intake of trans-fats, given that it made up only 0.4% of the total energy ingested by the volunteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Despite this, we observed an increase in the risk of suffering depression of nearly 50%. On this basis we derive the importance of taking this effect into account in countries like the U.S., where the percentage of energy derived from these foots is around 2.5%.&quot; one of the researchers said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the analysis suggests that both depression as well as cardiovascular disease are influenced in a similar manner by diet, and might share similar mechanisms in their origin. This hypothesis is further suggested by numerous studies that indicate the harmful effect of trans-fats on the risk of cardiovascular disease and on health in general.</p>', '2019-08-19 16:26:11', '2019-08-19 16:27:35', 8, 'olives_1566232041_jpg', 0, 'olive-oil', 10);
